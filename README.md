<h2>Overview</h2>
parroter uses tweepy and markovify to build a markov model of a given twitter user. It generates tweets based on that user's writing style and vocabulary.

To use, install the libaries in requirements.txt and enter your Twitter API credentials in creds.py. Then you can generate a model of a user with build_model.py and generate imitation tweets with generate.py.

This is sort of a prototype I wanted to throw together to see if it worked. Needs some adjustment to create more coherent tweets.
